If you want to use .mat files for classification, the specification should be as follows:

FT_EEG = 

         time: [1x750 double]
        label: {27x1 cell}
        trial: [513x27x750 double]
    trialinfo: [513x1 double]
       dimord: 'rpt_chan_time'


.time contains the time in seconds
.label contains the channel labels
.trial contains the actual data, first dimension is trial, second is dimension is electrode, last dimension is time
.trialinfo contains a condition number for each trial (should be numeric)
.dimord contains the order of the dimensions in .trial, can be left as ‘rpt_chan_time’.
